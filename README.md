# Hiring-process-analytics
The following project is about a hiring process in a Multinational Corporation
(MNC) like Google. According to the description we are working in Google as a
lead Data Analyst and are provided with a dataset consisting of multiple
columns like hiring status, gender, department, interview taken on, offered
salary etc. The project requires us to derive certain insights for the hiring status
and process for the company and calculate certain results using appropriate
excel formulas and depicting them in a way that can easily be interpreted by
individuals, thus using graphs and charts.
We will use EDA to generate different insights and to answer the questions
asked by the company. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to
analyse the data using visual techniques. It is used to discover trends, patterns,
or to check assumptions with the help of statistical summary and graphical
representations.

Steps for EDA:
1. Understanding data columns and data
2. Checking for missing data
3. Clubbing columns with multiple categories
4. Checking for outliers
5. Removing outliers
6. Drawing Data Summary
We will also use our knowledge in statistics and use different formulas in excel
and draw necessary conclusions about the company The things that we are
going to find out through this project are:
1. Hiring: How many males and females are Hired ?
2. Average Salary: What is the average salary offered in this company ?
3. Class Intervals: Draw the class intervals for salary in the company ?
4. Charts and Plots: Draw Pie Chart / Bar Graph ( or any other graph ) to show
proportion of people working different department ?
5. Charts: Represent different post tiers using chart/graph?
